Patch-up Roadmap:
	TODO: Set up destroy function for data lying around
	FIXME: Viewport list doesn't detect viewports if they are the default number?
	TODO: sort these sources ><
	TODO: Reduce memleaks related to windowlist & viewportlist
	TODO: Add ability to place files inline menu? (match filename up with appropriately split chunks?)
	TODO: Integrate compiz settings
	TODO: Add ability to write custom filter for recent documents
	TODO: Add compile flags for further tweakability (disabling/enabling certain features)
	TODO: Make this plugin able

	Difficult TODO: Add configuration for menu icon size (need to register icon size for 
compatibility? Also needs recent documents rewrite)

	Possible TODO: Variable expansion according to ~/.bashrc? (either tedious regex or just append sh -c '|\' to every command, which is stupidly insecure)
	Possible TODO: Make an Apwal-esque mode if requested
	TODO: Add some columns to the cache
